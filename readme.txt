Aautomatically alert your users when they've lost internet connectivity

== Description ==

Automatically alert your users when they've lost internet connectivity. The plugin uses customized [Offline.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/offline) which captures AJAX requests which were made while the connection was down, and remakes them when it's back up, so your app reacts perfectly.

### Install and activate the plugin. That's IT.

If you'd like to customize few things, go to Settings > Internet Connection Status.

Improve the experience of your site when your users lose connection.

* Beep sound when users loses their internet connectivity

* Automatically grabs ajax requests made while the connection is down and remakes them after the connection is restored.
