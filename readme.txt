Aautomatically alert your users when they've lost internet connectivity

== Description ==

Automatically alert your users when they've lost internet connectivity. The plugin enqueues [Offline.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/offline) by itself. It captures AJAX requests which were made while the connection was down, and remakes them when it's back up, so your app reacts perfectly.

Install and activate the plugin. That's it. Or if you'd like to customize few things, go to Settings > Internet Connection Status.

Keep the users entertained and engaged with a snake game while the connection is down. Improve your visitors abandonment problem.

Improve the experience of your site when your users lose connection.
